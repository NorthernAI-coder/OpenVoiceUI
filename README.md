## Install

**Prerequisite: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) must be installed and running for all install methods.**

### Pinokio (one-click)

Download [Pinokio](https://pinokio.co) if you don't have it, then search **"OpenVoiceUI"** in the app store and click **Install**.

### npm

```bash
npx openvoiceui setup     # interactive wizard — walks you through API keys + builds Docker images
npx openvoiceui start     # starts everything
```

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MCERQUA/OpenVoiceUI.git
cd OpenVoiceUI
cp .env.example .env        # edit with your API keys
docker compose up
```

Open **localhost:5001** and start talking.

## What is OpenVoiceUI?

OpenVoiceUI is a hands-free, AI-controlled computer. You talk — it builds. Live web apps, dashboards, games, full websites — rendered in real time while you watch. No mouse, no keyboard, no typing prompts into a chat box.

It runs on [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.org) and works with any LLM. The AI agent can build and display apps mid-conversation, switch between projects with a voice command, generate music on the fly, delegate work to parallel sub-agents, and remember everything across sessions. It uses any [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.org) skill — and the community can build and share more through the plugin system.

Self-hosted. Your hardware, your data. MIT licensed, forever free.

## Core Features

- **Hands-Free AI Computer** — Talk and watch it work. The AI builds apps, switches between projects, runs tasks, and displays results on a live visual canvas — all without touching a mouse or keyboard.
- **Live Canvas** — AI renders real HTML pages mid-conversation: dashboards, tools, galleries, reports, full web apps. Not text responses — real interactive pages you can use.
- **AI Music Generation** — Generate songs on the fly with your voice using Suno. Full music player with playlist management built in.
- **Custom Animated Interface** — Choose from animated face modes (eye-face avatar, reactive halo-smoke orb) or install community-built faces through plugins. Build your own — the face system is fully extensible.
- **Sub-Agents** — Delegate multiple tasks to parallel AI workers simultaneously and get results back.
- **Long-Term Memory** — Optional context engine plugin curates knowledge every turn. Persists across sessions in human-readable markdown.
- **Desktop OS Interface** — Themed desktop environment with window management (Windows XP, macOS, Ubuntu, Win95, Win 3.1).
- **Admin Dashboard** — Mobile-responsive. Agent profiles, provider config, workspace file browser, plugin management, system health. Everything editable live.
- **Self-Hosted** — Your hardware, your data. No vendor lock-in, no monthly fees.

## And More

- Image generation (FLUX.1, Stable Diffusion 3.5)
- Video creation (Remotion Studio)
- Voice cloning (Qwen3-TTS via fal.ai)
- Cron jobs for scheduled automation
- File explorer with drag-and-drop
- Agent profiles — switch personas, voices, and LLM providers from the admin panel

## Install Details

### Option 1: Pinokio (one-click)

1. Install [Pinokio](https://pinokio.co) if you don't have it
2. Search **"OpenVoiceUI"** in the Pinokio app store
3. Click **Install**, then **Start**

Pinokio handles Docker, dependencies, and configuration automatically.

### Option 2: npm

Requires **Node.js 20+**, **Python 3.10+**, and **Docker**.

```bash
npx openvoiceui setup     # interactive wizard — configures LLM, TTS, API keys, builds Docker images
npx openvoiceui start     # starts OpenClaw gateway + Supertonic TTS + voice UI
```

The setup wizard walks you through choosing an LLM provider, TTS provider, and entering API keys. Configuration is saved to `.env` and `openclaw-data/`.

```bash
npx openvoiceui stop      # stop all services
npx openvoiceui status    # check what's running
npx openvoiceui logs      # tail service logs
```

### Option 3: Docker

Requires **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MCERQUA/OpenVoiceUI.git
cd OpenVoiceUI
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your API keys (at minimum: an LLM provider key and optionally a TTS key). Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts three containers:

| Container | Port | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `openclaw` | 18791 | LLM gateway — routes to your chosen LLM provider |
| `supertonic` | (internal) | Free local TTS — no API key needed |
| `openvoiceui` | 5001 | Voice UI + Canvas + Admin dashboard |

Open **http://localhost:5001** to use the voice interface, or **http://localhost:5001/admin** for the admin dashboard.

To stop: `docker compose down`

### Option 4: VPS / Production

For running on an Ubuntu server with nginx and systemd:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MCERQUA/OpenVoiceUI.git
cd OpenVoiceUI
cp .env.example .env               # edit with your API keys
sudo bash deploy/setup-sudo.sh     # creates dirs, installs systemd service
bash deploy/setup-nginx.sh         # generates nginx config (edit domain)
```

See [`deploy/`](deploy/) for the full production setup including SSL, nginx reverse proxy, and systemd service files.

---

## Configuration

All configuration is in `.env`. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values.

**Required:**
- An LLM provider API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Z.AI, or any OpenClaw-compatible provider)
- `CLAWDBOT_AUTH_TOKEN` — set during `npx openvoiceui setup` or in OpenClaw's setup wizard

**Optional but recommended:**
- `GROQ_API_KEY` — enables Groq Orpheus TTS (fast, high quality, free tier)
- `SUNO_API_KEY` — enables AI music generation
- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — enables login/auth (for multi-user or public deployments)

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all available options with descriptions.
